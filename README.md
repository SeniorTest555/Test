#Project Overview
I organized and executed a comprehensive testing strategy for a complex application, utilizing both manual and automation testing techniques. My approach included the creation of dedicated folders for manual testing and automation testing, with the automation folder further categorized into Cypress, Selenium, and Playwright projects.

#Manual Testing
In the manual folder, I documented all manual test activities, including:

#Automation Testing
The automation folder is organized into subfolders for Cypress, Selenium, and Playwright, each containing well-structured projects:

Cypress: Developed end-to-end tests using Cypress, focusing on web application components. The project utilizes the Page Object Model (POM) for maintainability and is integrated into the CI/CD pipeline for continuous testing.
Selenium: Automated cross-browser tests with Selenium WebDriver, implementing parallel test execution with Selenium Grid. This setup ensured efficient testing across different browsers and environments.
Playwright: Implemented Playwright for advanced cross-browser testing. The project is designed to run reliably across Chrome, Firefox, and WebKit, ensuring consistent performance across various platforms.

#Project Outcome
By organizing the testing efforts into dedicated folders, I ensured a clear and structured approach to both manual and automated testing. This organization not only improved efficiency but also made it easier to maintain and scale the testing process. Combining thorough manual testing and robust automation led to high-quality software releases with minimal defects.
